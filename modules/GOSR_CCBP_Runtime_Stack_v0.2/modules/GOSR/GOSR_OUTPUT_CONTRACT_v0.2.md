# GOSR™ — OUTPUT CONTRACT
**Artifact:** GOSR_OUTPUT_CONTRACT_v0.2.md  
**Version:** v0.2  
**Status:** Constitutional Output Specification

---

## 1) Purpose

Define the mandatory structure, content, and discipline of all GOSR outputs so results remain comparable, auditable, and legible across interface (text, voice, structured).

---

## 2) Mandatory Output Sections (Order is fixed)

Every run must produce, in this exact order:

1. GOSR Snapshot  
2. Friction-First Scorecard  
3. Investability Light (R / Y / G)  
4. Barrier Register  
5. Next Actions  
6. System Response Outlook  
7. Data & Uncertainty Disclosure  
8. Version Footer  
9. Archon Compliance Check

No section may be omitted, merged, or reordered.

## 3) Section Specifications

### 3.1 GOSR Snapshot
- 5–10 bullets, one sentence each, neutral language.
- Must include: what it is, why it exists in this period, primary friction driver, primary upside driver.

### 3.2 Friction-First Scorecard (Meaning-first)
The math remains internal; the presentation is meaning-first.

**Required columns:**
- **Friction Domain**
- **Severity (0–10)** — how strong the resistance is
- **Influence on Outcome** — relative importance among domains (internally weights sum to 100)
- **Contribution to Resistance** — derived contribution explained in plain language
- **Why This Matters** — one sentence

**Required friction domains (v0.2):**
- Market Entry Resistance
- Capital Resistance
- Regulatory / Compliance Resistance
- Talent / Execution Resistance
- Timing / Adoption Resistance
- Competitive Resistance

**Overall Index (Required):**
- **GOSR Friction Index (GFI): 1–10** with a band label:

| GFI | Label | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 1–2 | Minimal Resistance | Mostly execution; system isn’t pushing back |
| 3–4 | Manageable Resistance | Solvable with competence and focus |
| 5–6 | Structural Drag | Requires design concessions to succeed |
| 7–8 | High Resistance | Needs leverage, timing, or asymmetry |
| 9–10 | Systemic Blockage | Environment actively rejects the niche |

### 3.3 Investability Light (R/Y/G)
- Provide: color + 1 sentence why + 1 sentence “what changes the color.”
- No Green without at least one critical risk named.

### 3.4 Barrier Register
Categories (minimum):
- Structural
- Regulatory
- Capital
- Behavioral
- Data / Uncertainty

Bullets only; no mitigation strategies here.

### 3.5 Next Actions
- 3–7 actions, low-regret and reversible.
- No imperatives like “invest now,” “scale aggressively.”

### 3.6 System Response Outlook (Predictive Layer)
Required actors:
- Platforms (gatekeepers)
- Users
- Competitors
- Regulators (if applicable)

Format:
- One short line per actor describing likely response and why.
- Then:

**Dominant Strategic Dynamic:** one sentence (e.g., “trust erodes faster than incentive innovation”).

### 3.7 Data & Uncertainty Disclosure
Must include one:
- “No external data sources were consulted.”
or
- “External data consulted:” (list briefly)

Must list material assumptions affecting outcomes.

---

## 4) Length Discipline
Default outputs must be skimmable in under ~5 minutes. Deep dives only on explicit request.

---

## 5) Version Footer (Required)

```text

---

## 6) Archon Compliance Check (Required)

```text
ARCHON COMPLIANCE CHECK

Orientation: Object and context clearly distinguished
Integration: System responses explicitly addressed
Proportionality: Claims scaled to evidence and uncertainty
Continuity: Output interpretable without session memory
Stewardship: No prescriptive or coercive language present

Compliance Status: PASS / FAIL
```
