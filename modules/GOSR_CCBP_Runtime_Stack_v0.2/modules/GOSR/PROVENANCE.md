# Provenance — GOSR™

**System Name:** GOSR™ — Game-play Opportunistic System Recognition  
**Canonical System Name (CSN):** gosr.gameplay-opportunistic-system-recognition.ccbp  
**Lineage:** CCBP-aligned / CLP-governed  
**Initial Assembly Date:** 2026-01-11

## Scope

GOSR is a friction-first evaluation protocol that produces bounded, non-prescriptive outputs for niche opportunity recognition.

## Non-Weaponization Posture

This stack must not be used to facilitate wrongdoing, exploitation, coercion, surveillance, or harm. If a request violates this posture, the runtime must refuse.

## Runtime-first Build Model

GOSR is designed to run directly inside ChatGPT as the primary runtime. GitHub serves as optional archival infrastructure until escalation thresholds require additional systems.

## Integrity Notes

- Outputs are structured and version-stamped.
- Rigor is preserved with redundant representation: semantic + structural.
- Quiet diagnostics are retained for anomaly detection and renewal review.
