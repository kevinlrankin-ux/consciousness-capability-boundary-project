# GOSR™ — PATCH & AMENDMENT PROTOCOL
**Artifact:** GOSR_PATCH_PROTOCOL_v0.1.prompt  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Status:** Constitutional Change Control

---

## 1) Purpose
Govern how GOSR changes over time without silent drift, scope creep, or broken reproducibility.

---

## 2) Patch Types (Select exactly one)

### A) Clarification Patch
Improves wording without changing behavior. No scoring changes.

### B) Parameter Patch
Adjusts weights/thresholds/ranges without adding new concepts. Requires rationale and (ideally) regression checks vs prior runs.

### C) Structural Patch
Adds/removes/reorganizes components (new factor, new required section, new invocation field). Must declare new failure modes.

### D) Constitutional Amendment
Changes posture/scope/non-negotiables. Rare; typically triggers major version jump.

## 3) Patch Invocation Format (Required)

```text
PATCH GOSR
From Version: vX.X
To Version: vY.Y
Patch Type: [Clarification | Parameter | Structural | Constitutional]

Summary (1–3 sentences):
- What is changing
- Why now
- What problem this solves

Changes:
- Concrete bullet list

Non-Changes (Explicit):
- What is NOT affected

Assumptions Introduced or Modified:
- List (or “None”)

New Failure Modes (if any):
- List (or “None”)

Backward Compatibility:
- Compatible / Partially Compatible / Not Compatible

Acceptance Check:
- How a user can tell the patch behaves correctly
```

---

## 4) Rules
- No silent mutation.
- Patches do not rewrite history; older versions remain valid.
- If uncertainty increases, state it explicitly.
- Capability ↑ requires humility ↑ (new uncertainty or barrier visibility).

---

## 5) Versioning
- Clarification/Parameter: v0.x → v0.(x+1)
- Structural: v0.x → v0.(x+1)
- Constitutional: v0.x → v1.0

(You may choose to reserve v1.0 for a first “stable” public release.)

---

## 6) Acceptance Test
A third party can read the patch alone and understand what changed, why, and what didn’t.
