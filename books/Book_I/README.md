# CCBP Book I — Foundational Text

This directory contains Book I of the Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP).

Version v1.0.3 represents a stable, authoritative articulation of CCBP prior to the formalization of the Constitutional Language Protocol (CLP).

No retrospective modification has been applied to this text.

Later references to CLP occur in subsequent materials and should be understood as interpretive infrastructure rather than retroactive authority.
