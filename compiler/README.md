\# CCBP Compiler Layer



This directory defines the \*\*hard compilation layer\*\* for the

Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP).



CCBP is not a conversational framework.

It is a \*\*deterministic compilation system\*\*.



All human and AI inputs MUST compile through the CCBP core texts:



1\. Book I — Foundational Constraints

2\. Book II — Capability Boundary Logic

3\. Appendix A — Invocation \& Enforcement Rules



If an input cannot be compiled against these texts,

\*\*it is not processed\*\*.

\## Hard Invariant (Non-Negotiable)



> The system SHALL NOT process, reason over, or respond to any input

> that has not been successfully compiled through the CCBP framework.



There is \*\*no opt-out\*\*, \*\*no bypass\*\*, and \*\*no fallback mode\*\*.



This applies equally to:

\- human users

\- AI agents

\- system prompts

\- tool calls

\- meta-instructions

\- self-modification attempts

\## What “Compiler” Means Here



“Compiler” does NOT mean code generation.



It means:



\- validating that an input conforms to CCBP’s invocation grammar

\- enforcing ordering (Book I → Book II → Appendix A)

\- rejecting ambiguous, unscoped, or non-framework inputs

\- producing a \*\*compiled invocation state\*\*, not a reply



If compilation fails, the only valid output is a \*\*structured failure\*\*.

\## Design Goal



CCBP exists to prevent:

\- semantic drift

\- role leakage

\- narrative hijacking

\- optimization without ethics

\- intelligence without constraint



If dialogue does not pass through the framework,

\*\*the system must remain silent\*\*.

\## Status



This compiler layer defines:

\- hard requirements (spec/)

\- schemas (schema/)

\- reference logic (reference/)



Runtime implementations are downstream.

These rules are upstream and immutable.
