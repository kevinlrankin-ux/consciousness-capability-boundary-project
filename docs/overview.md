# Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP)

This document provides a high-level, non-technical overview of the
Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP).

CCBP defines structural boundaries between consciousness, capability,
authority, and execution in complex systems — particularly AI systems —
without prescribing outcomes, policies, or enforcement mechanisms.

Authoritative specifications live in the protocol and module directories.
This overview is descriptive only and exists to introduce intent, scope,
and navigation for readers.
