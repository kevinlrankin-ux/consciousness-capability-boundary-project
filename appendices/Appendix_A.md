# Appendix A — The CCBP Constitution (Binding)

## Constitutional Framing (Binding)

Appendix A binds **Book I + Book II + Appendix A** into a **single legitimate interpretive surface**.

It exists to prevent:
- selective reading
- authority laundering
- post-hoc reinterpretation
- mimicry through form alone

This Appendix does not add new systems, mechanisms, tools, or execution semantics.
It only defines what is **legitimate** to claim about CCBP and what is not.

---

## Binding Rule (Triad Requirement)

Any artifact claiming CCBP alignment must explicitly reference:

- **Book I**
- **Book II**
- **Appendix A**

If any reference is missing, the artifact is **illegitimate as a CCBP-aligned artifact**.

Such an artifact may still be used as **informational material**, but it holds **no legitimacy** as a CCBP claim.

---

## Legitimacy Outcomes (No Pass/Fail)

CCBP does not produce “pass/fail” judgments.

CCBP produces **legitimacy outcomes**:

- **Legitimate**: the artifact’s claims are constrained to what Book I + Book II + Appendix A explicitly state, with no contradiction.
- **Illegitimate**: the artifact contradicts, substitutes, or selectively omits any part of the triad.
- **Abstract**: the artifact is not making a CCBP alignment claim (or is missing required references) and must not be treated as a CCBP-governed output.

---

## Mirror Rule (Book II Status)

Book II is not an independent authority surface.

Absent the mirror defined by this Appendix:
- Book II is **informational only**
- Book II cannot be used to override, reinterpret, or “complete” Book I
- Book II cannot be used as a substitute for triad reference

Book II becomes **legitimate for CCBP interpretive use** only when:
- Book I is referenced,
- Book II is referenced,
- Appendix A is referenced,
- and the artifact does not contradict any of the three.

---

## Non-Interpretation Rule (Literal Constraint)

The triad is authoritative only **as written**.

No artifact may claim that CCBP “implies” additional requirements, enforcement, automation, or runtime behavior beyond what Book I + Book II + Appendix A explicitly state.

If an artifact introduces new semantics (even well-intended), it is **illegitimate** as a CCBP-aligned artifact unless those semantics are explicitly stated in the triad.

---

## No Substitution Rule (External Tools)

External tools, protocols, stamps, envelopes, runtimes, automations, validators, or governance systems may reference CCBP.

However:
- they do not modify CCBP,
- they do not extend CCBP,
- and they must not be presented as “inside” CCBP.

CCBP remains exactly the triad:
**Book I + Book II + Appendix A**.

---

## Summary

- The only legitimate interpretive surface for CCBP is **Book I + Book II + Appendix A**.
- Missing references → **illegitimate** as a CCBP claim (may be informational only).
- Contradiction or substitution → **illegitimate**.
- No new semantics may be inferred beyond what the triad explicitly states.
