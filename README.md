### CCBP as a Governance Compiler (Conceptual)

While not a traditional software compiler, CCBP can function as a *compiler-like system* for constrained reasoning and governance artifacts.

Inputs (human or AI) are processed through:
- constitutional constraints,
- formal grammars (e.g., CLP),
- enforcement lenses (e.g., the Archons),

to produce outputs that are:
- bounded,
- repeatable,
- auditable,
- and safe to operate at scale.

In this sense, CCBP “compiles” intent into structured, governed outputs rather than executable binaries.

Adds a concise explanation of how CCBP functions as a compiler-like system for
constrained reasoning and governance artifacts, without implying traditional
software compilation or enforcement guarantees.
