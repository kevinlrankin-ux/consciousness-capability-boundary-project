## Constitutional Posture & Scope

This repository is governed by the **Consciousnessâ€“Capability Boundary Project (CCBP)**.

All documents, prompts, and runtimes in this repo **inherit** the following constraints:

- **Provenance & Posture:**  
  See [`CCBP_PROVENANCE_HEADER.md`](./CCBP_PROVENANCE_HEADER.md)

- **Explicit Non-Scope (â€œWhat This Does NOT Doâ€):**  
  See [`CCBP_NOT_DOES.md`](./CCBP_NOT_DOES.md)

These files define:
- the systemâ€™s non-conscious, non-agentic posture
- mandatory non-claims (no awareness, intent, agency, or moral standing)
- non-directive authority and human-retained responsibility
- boundaries that prevent anthropomorphic or moral drift

Any work claiming CCBP alignment **must not contradict** these documents.

## Ease of Use & Interoperability

CCBP is designed to be usable **without specialized tooling**.

### Supported Usage Modes

**Text (Default)**
- Copy/paste runtime prompts directly into ChatGPT or compatible systems
- Reference CCBP constraints instead of restating them

**Voice**
- CCBP constraints are compatible with voice-based interfaces
- Spoken prompts may be used provided they do not introduce anthropomorphic claims
- Outputs remain capability-only and non-agentic regardless of modality

**PDF / Static Documents**
- CCBP documents are intentionally written to survive PDF conversion
- PDFs may be uploaded to analytical systems as reference context
- Canonical posture is preserved through explicit provenance and non-scope files

### System Compatibility

CCBP artifacts are:
- human-readable
- machine-ingestable
- safe for upload as context into analytical systems
- suitable for citation, review, and reuse

No compilation, plugins, or proprietary formats are required.

### Reading Order (Recommended)

1. `CCBP_PROVENANCE_HEADER.md`
2. `CCBP_NOT_DOES.md`
3. This README
4. Core specs and runtime prompts

### CCBP as a Governance Compiler (Conceptual)

While not a traditional software compiler, CCBP can function as a *compiler-like system* for constrained reasoning and governance artifacts.

Inputs (human or AI) are processed through:
- constitutional constraints,
- formal grammars (e.g., CLP),
- enforcement lenses (e.g., the Archons),

to produce outputs that are:
- bounded,
- repeatable,
- auditable,
- and safe to operate at scale.

In this sense, CCBP â€œcompilesâ€ intent into structured, governed outputs rather than executable binaries.

Adds a concise explanation of how CCBP functions as a compiler-like system for
constrained reasoning and governance artifacts, without implying traditional
software compilation or enforcement guarantees.
