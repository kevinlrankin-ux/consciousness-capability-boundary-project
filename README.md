## Constitutional Posture & Scope

This repository is governed by the **Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP)**.

All documents, prompts, and runtimes in this repo **inherit** the following constraints:

- **Provenance & Posture:**  
  See [`CCBP_PROVENANCE_HEADER.md`](./CCBP_PROVENANCE_HEADER.md)

- **Explicit Non-Scope (“What This Does NOT Do”):**  
  See [`CCBP_NOT_DOES.md`](./CCBP_NOT_DOES.md)

These files define:
- the system’s non-conscious, non-agentic posture
- mandatory non-claims (no awareness, intent, agency, or moral standing)
- non-directive authority and human-retained responsibility
- boundaries that prevent anthropomorphic or moral drift

Any work claiming CCBP alignment **must not contradict** these documents.

### CCBP as a Governance Compiler (Conceptual)

While not a traditional software compiler, CCBP can function as a *compiler-like system* for constrained reasoning and governance artifacts.

Inputs (human or AI) are processed through:
- constitutional constraints,
- formal grammars (e.g., CLP),
- enforcement lenses (e.g., the Archons),

to produce outputs that are:
- bounded,
- repeatable,
- auditable,
- and safe to operate at scale.

In this sense, CCBP “compiles” intent into structured, governed outputs rather than executable binaries.

Adds a concise explanation of how CCBP functions as a compiler-like system for
constrained reasoning and governance artifacts, without implying traditional
software compilation or enforcement guarantees.
