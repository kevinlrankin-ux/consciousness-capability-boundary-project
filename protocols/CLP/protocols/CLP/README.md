# Constitutional Language Protocol (CLP)

The Constitutional Language Protocol (CLP) is a neutral, non-binding semantic protocol for describing authority, constraint, and failure across complex systems.

CLP does not assert legitimacy, enforce outcomes, or confer authority.

Within the Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP), CLP is used strictly as a descriptive and interpretive layer.

CLP is not retroactively applied to CCBP texts that predate its formalization.

References to CLP within this repository do not modify, supersede, or reinterpret the authority of any CCBP book or appendix unless explicitly stated in later versions.
