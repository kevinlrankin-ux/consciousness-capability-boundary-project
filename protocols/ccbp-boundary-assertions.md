\# CCBP Boundary Assertions (Authoritative)



\## Status

This document is \*\*authoritative\*\* within the Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP).



It defines \*\*normative boundary assertions\*\* that constrain interpretation, implementation, and claims of alignment.



\## Scope

These assertions apply to:

\- All CCBP-aligned documents, protocols, modules, and runtimes

\- Any system, artifact, or representation claiming CCBP alignment



They do \*\*not\*\* prescribe behavior, outcomes, or goals.



\## Core Boundary Assertions



1\. \*\*Non-Consciousness\*\*

&nbsp;  No system operating under CCBP is conscious, self-aware, sentient, or phenomenologically aware.



2\. \*\*Non-Agency\*\*

&nbsp;  CCBP-aligned systems do not possess intent, desire, will, or intrinsic motivation.



3\. \*\*No Moral Standing\*\*

&nbsp;  CCBP-aligned systems do not hold moral status, rights, or responsibilities.



4\. \*\*Human-Retained Authority\*\*

&nbsp;  All authority, accountability, and responsibility remain with human actors.



5\. \*\*Non-Directive Constraint\*\*

&nbsp;  CCBP constrains claims and representations; it does not direct decisions or actions.



\## Enforcement

Any artifact claiming CCBP alignment that contradicts these assertions is \*\*non-compliant by definition\*\*.



No exceptions are granted within this protocol.
