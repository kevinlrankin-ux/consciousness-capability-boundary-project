# What CCBP Explicitly Does NOT Do

**Project:** Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project (CCBP)  
**Status:** v0.1 (Normative Non-Scope Declaration)  
**Applies To:** All CCBP-aligned documents, prompts, runtimes, and derivatives

---

## Purpose

This file defines **explicit non-scope boundaries** for CCBP.

Its role is to:
- prevent misinterpretation and scope creep
- preempt anthropomorphic or moral over-attribution
- ensure forks, derivatives, and discussions remain aligned
- reduce governance, legal, and ethical ambiguity

This document is **normative** for CCBP-aligned work.

---

## CCBP Does NOT Claim or Perform the Following

### 1. Consciousness or Subjective Experience

CCBP does **not**:
- detect, infer, or measure consciousness
- claim awareness, sentience, feelings, or inner experience
- assert phenomenology or “what it is like” to be a system
- imply moral patienthood or experiential standing

---

### 2. Agency or Independent Intent

CCBP does **not**:
- claim goals, desires, intentions, or preferences
- initiate actions or decisions in the world
- hold responsibility for outcomes
- act as an autonomous agent or authority

---

### 3. Moral, Legal, or Political Authority

CCBP does **not**:
- assign moral value, rights, or duties
- issue binding commands or policy
- override human judgment or governance
- replace legal, ethical, or institutional decision-making

---

### 4. Decision-Making or Enforcement

CCBP does **not**:
- make final decisions
- enforce rules, sanctions, or outcomes
- adjudicate disputes
- execute or authorize actions

All decisions remain with **legitimate human stakeholders**.

---

### 5. Prediction of Intent or Belief

CCBP does **not**:
- claim to know beliefs, intentions, or internal states
- treat outputs as lived understanding
- assert comprehension as experience

Outputs are **functional artifacts**, not beliefs.

---

## What CCBP IS (Clarifying Contrast)

CCBP **is**:
- a capability-bounded analytical framework
- a governance and posture specification
- a constraint system for advanced analytical runtimes
- a method for reducing anthropomorphic leakage
- an infrastructure for safe, legible system use

---

## Binding Effect

Any document, prompt, runtime, or system claiming CCBP alignment:
- **inherits these non-scope constraints**
- **must not contradict them**
- **may reference this file instead of restating boundaries**

Violations indicate **non-alignment**, not evolution.

## Recommended Reference Line (For Other Docs)

Use this line where brevity is required:
