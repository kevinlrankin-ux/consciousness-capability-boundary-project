\# CCBP CLI



\## Purpose

This CLI is a strict interface to the CCBP Shared Engine.



It exists to prove:

\- humans cannot bypass the compiler invariant

\- all input is either compiled or refused

\- zero interpretive logic lives at the CLI layer



\## Command

```bash

ccbp compile "<input>"
